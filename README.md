## With the Help of Github Pages kagancansit.github.io is Live!

This repository hosts the source code for my personal website, available at [https://kagancansit.github.io](https://kagancansit.github.io). The site serves as a portfolio, blog, and personal branding platform.

Honestly, I am not a professional web developer and do not particularly enjoy spending too much time with these technologies. My main goal is to try new things, learn, discover, share, and meet new people. For this reason, the current usage is sufficient for me, but if you would like to use your web knowledge and help me, I would be very grateful. Note that the content in this repository is based on an edited template from [Marvel](https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page270/marvel).

If you want to use GitHub Pages to create your own personal site, it's very easy. Please refer to the following documentation:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [GitHub Pages Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)
- [Configuring a Publishing Source for Your GitHub Pages Site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)

By the way, you can also find plenty of useful resources on YouTube and Medium.

# ! Warning
