## With the Help of Github Pages kagancansit.github.io is Live!
My blog that I created with the help of the HTML5 template and github page I created to share what I learned, discovered and meet new people. I am open to comments. Help me improve! You can visit [kagancansit.github.io](https://kagancansit.github.io) to have an idea about my site. You can view the images below.

You can access ready-made HTML templates from this [site](https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page270/marvel).

There may be differences after updates. I look forward to your feedback so that I can develop it.
Stay well.
